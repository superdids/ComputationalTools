    "title": "BAHIA COCOA REVIEW",
    "body": "Showers continued throughout the week in\nthe Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early\nJanuary and improving prospects for the coming temporao,\nalthough normal humidity levels have not been restored,\nComissaria Smith said in its weekly review.\n    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.\n    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags\nof 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93\nmln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems\nthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the\narrivals figures.\n    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how\nmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has\npractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates\naround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there\nare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,\nmiddlemen, exporters and processors.\n    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit\nfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in\nobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.\n    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have\nsold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.\n    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350\ncruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.\n    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and\nonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to\n1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.\n    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with\nJune/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs\nunder New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs\nper tonne FOB.\n    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at\n4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.\n    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July\nat 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at\n2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and\n2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.\n    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,\nUruguay and open ports.\n    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for\nMarch/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times\nNew York Dec for Oct/Dec.\n    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible\ncurrency areas.\n    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325\nand 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New\nYork July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York\nSept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith\nsaid.\n    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags\nagainst the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88\ncrop.\n    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to\nbe published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after\ncarnival which ends midday on February 27.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

They were not energetic in attempting to protect the\npresident from the consequences,\" it said.\n    White House chief of staff Donald Regan and former Central\nIntelligence Agency Director William Casey also received strong\ncriticism, but the blows were expected in their cases.\n    Regan, expected to resign or be fired shortly, was savaged\nfor allegedly failing both to help Reagan conduct the Iran\ninitiative and to avoid \"chaos\" in the disclosure process.\n    Casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a cancerous\nbrain tumor in December, had already resigned for health\nreasons last month.\n    \"This is a story about people who came up somewhat short of\nbeing heroes,\" Tower told reporters.\n    While Reagan retains considerable constitutional powers,\nincluding command of the armed forces and the right to veto\nlegislation, analysts say it will be difficult for him to\nretake control of the country's policy agenda -- particularly\nwith Congress controlled by the Democrats.\n    The crucial remaining question, they said, is whether the\nman in the street will forsake Reagan over the affair.\n    Although his job approval rating has fallen as much as\ntwenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms\ndeal with Iran became public last November, his personal\npopularity is still relatively high.\n    A Los Angeles Times poll released earlier this week showed\nthat just 37 pct of those surveyed thought Reagan was in\ncontrol of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was\ndoing a good job as president.\n    American Enterprise Institute analyst William Schneider, a\nDemocrat, says Reagan's loss of support among Washington power\nbrokers could be offset by continued backing of the public.\n    \"In the past, he has been able to go around the power elite\nby appealing directly to the public,\" Schneider said.\n    Reagan will again plead his case that way in a televised\naddress next week.\n    But one top Republican strategist warned against expecting\na dramatic turnaround.\n    \"The White House has to avoid building expectations that\ncannot be met,\" said the strategist, who requested anonymity.\n\"They have to recognize there is no quick fix.\"\n    Analysts also point out that Reagan's personal popularity\nhas not always translated into public backing for his policies.\n    They note he was dramatically rebuffed in last November's\nelections when voters rejected his appeals and restored control\nof the Senate to the Democrats.\n Reuter\n\u0003",

    "body": "Quebecor Inc, one of Canada's largest\npublishing and printing companies, is likely to launch a new\ndaily newspaper in Montreal, probably this fall, president\nPierre Peladeau told Reuters in an interview.\n    The company, which last week won a bid to buy the Quebec\ngovernment's 55 pct interest in pulp and paper company <Donohue\nInc>, will also likely go ahead with plans to build a new paper\nmill in Matane, Quebec, Peladeau said.\n    \"I would say we will move (ahead with the daily).... This\nis not definite but i think we will,\" he said, adding that he\nplans to announce a decision early next week.\n    Quebecor, which had revenues of 446 mln Canadian dlrs last\nyear and profit of 16.2 mln dlrs, already publishes three daily\nnewspapers, including the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, the\nsecond-largest circulation paper in Canada.\n    A new daily would give Montreal its second English-\nlanguage paper and its sixth daily newspaper, making the city\nthe most crowded metropolitan newspaper market in North\nAmerica, analysts have said.\n    Peladeau said market studies have indicated a new English\nlanguage tabloid would have circulation of 50,000 within six\nmonths. He said he is waiting to determine whether the new\nventure would have the support of major advertisers.\n    Peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55\npct of Quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of\ntwo major Canadian companies who are interested in the project\nbut has not decided whether he would take partners in the\nnewspaper venture.\n    He said he would consider launching the newspaper with one\nof the companies as a prelude to other joint ventures.\n    \"It would be the possibility of doing something else in the\nshort term,\" Peladeau said.\n    Peladeau said the joint acquisition of Donohue with Robert\nMaxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp plc <BPCL.L>\ndoes not mean Quebecor will have to hold off on other projects.\n    Peladeau and Maxwell's companies teamed up to buy the stake\nin Donohue, which resulted in Quebecor buying 51 pct of the\ngovvernment's stake for about 165 mln Canadian dlrs and British\nprinting acquiring the other 49 pct.\n    \"In 1976 or 77 there was a tremendous shortage of\nnewsprint. There were days when we didn't have enough paper to\nprint the paper,\" Peladeau said. \"When I lived that, I said to\nmyself...next time we'll be ready.\"\n    Peladeau said most of Donohue's current total newsprint\ncapacity however, is already committed to other buyers.\n    Quebecor uses about 100,000 metric tons of newsprint a year\nand Maxwell's company, which publishes Britain's Daily Mirror\nnewspaper, uses about 200,000 tonnes.\n    Peladeau said even with a new 170 mln dlr paper machine, 49\npct owned by the New York Times, (NYT.A), adding to Donohue's\n540,000 metric tonne capacity this fall, the companies will\nhave to install another paper machine at Amos, Quebec, or build\nanother mill to meet their demands .\n    He said a new mill, which would produce either newsprint or\nother types of paper, would cost 400-500 mln dlrs and could be\non stream in two years. He said a mill in Matane, a depressed\narea with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the\ngovernment.\n    Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures\nwith Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in\nFrance or in the U.S., where the company owns two large\nprinting plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.\n    He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would\nprovide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are\nprevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would\nconsider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in\nFrance or the U.S.\n    Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of\nabout 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of\ntwo groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating\nthe acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada,\nPeladeau said.\n    He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers\nin two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the\nprovince.\n    Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its\nlisting on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock\nExchange listing.\n Reuter\n\u0003",
